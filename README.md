# Programming Language 
**The goal of this project is to create a programming language from scratch using Rust as the backend**

The following features to creating a programming language:

- [X] **Lexer: Convert program source code into tokens that represent important information such as alphabets or keywords: false, return, true, etc**
- [] **Parser: Convert token stream into an abstract syntax tree or AST. Consume tokens that match the grammar, otherwise leave them alone**
- [] **Intermediate representations
- [] **Optimization
- [] **Virtual Machine
